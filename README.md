Introduction (Vid.1): 

What is React? 
- a JavaScript library created by Facebook (also used by Netflix and Insta) 
- Used to create dynamic JS-driven web apps

What is Redux? 
- a layer on top of React that helps with state management of our app - like our data and the UI state of the app (is the port open or closed? is the menu open or closed?)

How React Works (Vid.2): 
The lifeblood of React is COMPONENTS. 
For example: NavBar, Search Box, and Footer will all be components. It is React's job to take those components and inject them into the DOM so we can see them on the webpage.

NavBar --> Virtual Dom (New and Old comparison to updates) --> Browser 

How? 
React creates a JavaScript representation of the DOM (Virtual DOM) and it renders it to the browser -- thus, we see the components. 
Everytime we change one of those components, React will see & update it to the DOM very quickly. 

COMPONENTS 
- look like HTML templates, but they're actually JSX (JavaScript XML) 
- They contain the 'state' (data or UI state) 
- also contain JavaScript for functionality
